# RNAseq Workshop at NMNH

These are the [materials](https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/2020-01-28-NMNH-RNAseq/tree/master/Materials) used for the RNAseq course given at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum on January 28th 2020. 

**Note: This tutorial has been updated and modified from the Trinity tutorial given by Brian Haas [here](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/KrumlovTrinityWorkshopJan2016/wiki/Home/e67c7a4ae4fe005866a56371ea29f15c79e8ccfb) for use on the Smithsonian HPC. We will also use data from [Defining the transcriptomic landscape of Candida glabrata by RNA-Seq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25586221). We are very grateful that these materials have been made public by the Trinity team!**
