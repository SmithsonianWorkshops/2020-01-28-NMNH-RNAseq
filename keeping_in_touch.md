Carpentries-Alumni Slack Channel
--------------------------------

Slack is a message board/chat system. We only set up this channel in the past week, and will be inviting all other Carpentries "alumni" on Monday, so you are all pioneers!

1. Sign up for the Smithsonian Slack. If you already are a part of the Smithsonian Slack workspace, skip to Step #3. Go to https://smithsonian.slack.com/signup, and enter your SI email account (must be @si.edu).
2. You will get an email from Slack, and click Confirm Email. This link will send you to a page where you will fill in your name, and set a password. After doing this, you will be logged into Slack and prompted to "Explore Slack". I recommend go through this tour if you are unfamiliar with the system.
3. You will automatically be "added" to the #general and #random "channels". These channels appear at the top of the list of all channels on the left side, and all others are greyed-out. Click on the greyed-out #carpentries-alumni, and then click the "Join Channel" button in the main window. If you do not see #carpentries-alumni as an option, click "+ Add a channel" below the list of channels. Search for carpentries-alumni, then click on the link to go to the channel. At the bottom of the screen, click the "Join Channel" button to join the channel.
